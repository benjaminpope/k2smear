K2 Smear Data

### What's in this repo?

Following on from the [Kepler Smear Campaign](https://github.com/benjaminpope/smearcampaign) I produced a very partial catalogue of light curves from smear in K2, but abandoned this for the [K2 Bright Star Survey](https://github.com/benjaminpope/k2halo) using [halo photometry](https://github.com/hvidy/halophot).

I am putting these light curves here to share and figure out what to do next! If you are interested in collaborating, [email me](mailto:benjamin.pope@nyu.edu).
